Message Storage
===============

When you have an account and make an email address private, message storage kicks in.

Message storage comes into play in two ways. It governs:

* The number of messages allowed across your owned email addresses
* The number of starred messages

When are Messages Recycled?
---------------------------

The **oldest, unstarred** messages are removed.

Example
~~~~~~~

If your storage limit is 100 messages, and you star 25 messages, and you own 3 email addresses,
you’ll be allowed 75 messages across those 3 email addresses.

Once you have 100 messages across all your starred and private email addresses, the oldest unstarred
ones will be removed.

Getting More Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Message storage can be purchased on a per-message basis in blocks listed on the `pricing page
<https://mailsac.com/pricing>`_.

Starred (saved) Messages
------------------------
Mailsac will delete messages on regular intervals. One way around this is to create an account and
star messages so they will be saved.

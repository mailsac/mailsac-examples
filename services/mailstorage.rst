Message Storage
===============

All `plans <https://mailsac.com/pricing>`_ include message storage. The amount
of message storage is how many messages can be stored before mail before
messages are recycled.

Messages that are sent to a :ref:`private domain <doc_privatedomains>`, private 
address, or `starred messages`_ count towards message storage.

When are Messages Recycled?
---------------------------

Messages sent to non-private addresses and domains will be recycled at times
to ensure capacity for new messages.

Messages sent to :ref:`private domains <doc_privatedomains>`, private addresses,
and `starred messages`_ associated with Mailsac are recycled once the storage 
limit is reached.

Examples
--------

1. If your storage limit is 100 messages and you have starred 125 messages, the
   oldest 25 messages will be recycled.
2. If your storage limit is 100 messages and you have 75 messages in your
   private domain. No messages will be recycled.
3. If your storage limit is 100 messages and you have 150 messages in your
   private domain, the oldest 50 messages will be recycled.
4. If your storage limit is 100 messages and you have 50 messages in 3
   private inboxes (total 150 messages), the oldest 50 messages will be
   recycled.


Getting More Storage
--------------------
Message storage can be purchased on a per-message basis in blocks listed on the 
`pricing page <https://mailsac.com/pricing>`_.

Starred Messages
----------------
When you star a message, it counts towards your overall storage. 

:red:`Use the star symbol â˜…`

Your user `dashboard <https://mailsac.com/dashboard>`_ has links to all 
inboxes where you starred messages.

You can star messages on any address, including those you own or other 
public addresses.

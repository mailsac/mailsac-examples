Private Domains
===============

Private domains allow an unlimited number of email addresses within a domain.

BYODomain
---------

BYODomain allows you to easily receive email at a domain or subdomain you already own. 
If you do not already own a domain you can use our Zero-Setup Subdomain or you can purchase a domain 
from a registrar (`Namecheap <https://namecheap.com>`_ or `GoDaddy <https://godaddy.com>`_).

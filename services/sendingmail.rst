Sending Mail
============

Sending mail, both replies and new messages, is available only if you have an
account and are logged in. `It takes a few seconds to create an account
<https://mailsac.com/register>`_. Sending or replying requires `mail credits
<https://mailsac.com/pricing>`_.

Sending From mailsac.com or Custom Domain
-----------------------------------------
You can send from any unowned address @mailsac.com, or send from your accountâ€™s
owned domains.

If somebody owns an email address, you will not be able to send mail as that
address. Thus, to prevent other people from sending messages as your favorite
address, you can make that address private.

Sending From a Custom Domain
----------------------------
First, `verify ownership of your domain
<https://mailsac.com/verified-domains>`_ to send from your custom domain.

Sent Messages Are Not Saved
---------------------------
Outgoing messages are not saved. They may be visible or cached temporarily by
our outgoing mail services, and logged in debugging messages on Mailsac
servers, but not explicitly archived by Mailsac at this time.

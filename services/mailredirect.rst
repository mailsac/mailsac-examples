Alternate Address Redirect
==========================

One of the downsides of public disposable email is that when you give out the
address, and people know it is disposable, they might know they can view your
mail!

But there’s a way around that. You can still keep your inbox private.

The 'redirect' or 'alternate' Address
-------------------------------------

Underneath each email address, on the main inbox page, is a special redirect
address.

The alternate email address begins with“**inbox**-“ and has a long string of
characters after it.

Any mail sent to the alternate/redirect address will be delivered to the actual address on the page.

**Redirect emails work for custom domains** as well. The alternate address will
always display the domain as “@mailsac.com” – which will work – **but you can
also change the domain to your custom domain (or any domain** that receives
mail at Mailsac).

For example, if the alternate address for your email, dude@example.com is
inbox-55443445kk4Knxns@mailsac.com, you can use that one, or replace the domain
with your own. It would be inbox-55443445kk4Knxns@example.com.

Of course, Mailsac offers private inboxes, too. If you `create an account
<https://mailsac.com/register>`_,
you’ll be able to see the options for getting private mail. Then you can give
out your actual email address without worrying whether people know it is
public.

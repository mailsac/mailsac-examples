Email Attachments
=================

By clicking the Download button on any message, you can open in locally in an email client and view the attachements.

For security and to ensure the Mailsac website is not marked as a distributor of spam, attachments are not accessible from the web user interface.

Attachments can be parsed out of the raw message using the `API <https://mailsac.com/docs/api/#example-email-message-object>`_.

Attachments on outgoing messages are only supported through the API.

Private Domains
===============

Private domains allow an unlimited number of email addresses within a domain.
Private domains can be `purchased <https://mailsac.com/pricing>`_ as an addon
or as part of a plan.

BYODomain
---------

BYODomain (Bring Your Own Domain) allows you to easily receive email with a
domain or subdomain you already own. If you do not already own a domain you can
use our Zero-Setup Subdomain. Alternatively, you can purchase a domain from a
registrar (`Namecheap <https://namecheap.com>`_ or
`GoDaddy <https://godaddy.com>`_) and configure it for Mailsac.

Zero-Setup Subdomain
--------------------

The Zero-Setup Subdomain automatically creates a subdomain under msdc.co (eg
test123.msdc.co) that is ready to receive email with no additional setup. This
is the ideal option if you do not own a domain or do not have access to change
the DNS records for a domain.

Zero-Setup Subdomain Configuration
==================================

Setting up a Zero-Setup domain only takes a few seconds.

#. From the `dashboard <https://mailsac.com/dashboard>`_, select `Verified
   Domains <https://mailsac.com/domains>`_.

#. Send a test email to any address at in the private domain. There is no
   need to configure individual addresses. Sending an email to the address
   creates the address.

#. Enter the email address you sent the email to.

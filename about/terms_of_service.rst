you (also "user", "the user", "end user", "customer", "account) accept these terms and the Privacy Policies (separate agreement) and agree to ABIDE BY THEM AT ALL TIMES WITH NO EXCEPTION, and with no right to a refund in the event of terms violation.

You accept that any of these policies and procedures will be available on the website but
that THESE TERMS MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE - you have been warned. We recommend subscribing to the
public repository where this document's source is hosted.

Terms and policies apply to paid and unpaid features of Mailsac.

2. Warnings and Acceptable Use

* This service is offered for use with NO WARRANTIES and MAKES NO PROMISES THAT IT WILL FUNCTION AS INTENDED OR UNINTENDED. There is no "service level agreement" nor any guarantee of service uptime. We provide uptime system metrics, such as https://status.mailsac.com, on a purely information basis. Nor is status or uptime information required to be available.

3. Commercial and Non-Commercial Use
------------------------------------
3a. Personal (where personal is non-business and non-commercial) use of this website is free, though it may require
the user to register for an account and provide information such as a legal name, username, email address, phone number,
physical address, and password. We will store the password using a one-way hash which cannot be retrieved by Mailsac.

3b. Using this service for any business operations, even once, necessitates the purchase of a subscription-based license. Incorporated or non-incorporated business use is prohibited without a paid recurring active commercial subscription.

3c. An exception the previous clause (3c) is made when a business is evaluating the service on a temporary trial basis.
Service usage for evaluation purposes will require the business to abide by these terms, the acceptable use guidelines, and the Privacy Policy (separate agreement).

4. Email
--------
4a. Public and Private Email

This site provides public disposable email services and mixed public-private email testing services. Email inboxes that are not purchased (aka private) are public and have no expectation of privacy whatsoever.

Private addresses will not be accessible publicly and access to messages will be provided only to
those with:
- a validated username and password, which grants a temporary access "session" which may be stored in a cookie
- a validated API key (smtp key, api access key, or other key)

If you believe your username, password, or API key has been compromised, you agree to:
1. change your compromised password, or delete the compromised API key
2. and contact the Mailsac support email address immediately.

Mailsac does not accept responsibility for damages done by compromised accounts. Users acknowledge that overseers and
associates (internal or external parties) may have access to inbox contents for the purpose of
ongoing business operations, but that access and insight will be limited based on direct need, such as but not limited to:
- billing and subscription help
- troubleshooting SMTP or API issues reported by you, or issues alerted by Mailsac telemetry systems
- system integration support from Mailsac to you
- comprise the standard reasons for such access

We may aggregate information included in emails, inbound and oubound metadata, email attachements,
or email body information, for sale or sharing with third parties or customers. This aggregated information is useful
for understanding system trends, spam and viruses sent by malicious systems.

The Privacy Policy supercedes this agreement, and outlines additional detail around sharing of public and private email. When in doubt, THE USER ASSUMES
CONTENTS OF THEIR DATA ON MAILSAC.COM MAY BE SHARED WITH OTHER PARTIES. Mailsac is not a service for conducting sensitive 
or private matters.

4b. Receipt, Delivery, and Message Accuracy Guarantees

EMAIL MESSAGE RECEIPT AND DELIVERY IS NOT GUARANTEED. Mailsac.com has many processes and systems in place
built up over years, which result in high availability and reliability. Nonetheless the service does NOT
provide a Service Level Agreement or any certainty of either receiving OR sending mail.

While this service does not intend for messages to be altered,
there may be arbitrary changes whether during transit or storage which are made without knowledge of
the user. The user's account username and IP address may be attached to inbound or outbound email messages.

We cannot guarantee accuracy of any email content. Furthermore this service does not know
the quality, truthfulness, correctness, or origination of messages received. Email messages may contain
viruses. Users acknowledge this and will not hold Mailsac responsible for the content of messages. Users acknowledge that outside
parties often send malicious code, phishing (intentionally misleading content), and spam in email messages, and Mailsac
is unable to accurately determine whether messages are malicious or not. Spam ratings and spam scores are for
informational purposes only - the user acknowledges these may indicate non-spam is spam, and spam is non-spam.

4c. Email Security

The user acknowledges:

- SMTP and its variants are insecure by design
- SMTP is a fail-prone protocol
- SMTP is a "legacy" technology which lacks modern security best practices
- the SMTP protocol is not guaranteed to be transmitted under encryption
- when encrypted in transit, email may use broken or insufficient encryption algorithms
- stored emails may not be encrypted at rest
- third parties (including but not limited to routers, ISPs, intermediary providers, email providers including Mailsac) may decrypt and store email, even though it was not the message's final destination
- Mailsac strives for encrypted traffic (HTTPS with TLS, SMTP with TLS), however internal traffic or even public API / UI traffic may be transmitted unencrypted

4d. Sending Outbound Mail

Outgoing mail may be purchased at cost and may be delivered (relayed) by a third party OR Mailsac. The user and sender of
this mail is responsible for the content they send. Delivery cannot be guaranteed. Messages which fail to be
delivered (including but not limited to "bounces") will not be refunded. Contact Mailsac support if delivery appears to be failing and we may
be able to assist with troubleshooting, but again we make no guarantees about outbound message delivery.

Outgoing mail may be marked as spam by receivers or intermediary deliverers. Mailsac is not
responsible for email delivered by Mailsac being marked as spam, and WILL NOT refund such mail which is 
marked as spam or undelivered or unviewed.

Sending spam email is a serious offense which may result the user's account being immediately disabled.

IN THE EVENT THAT LEGAL EXPENSES OR FINANCIAL JUDGEMENTS ARE INCURRED FOR THE SENDING OF EMAIL MESSAGES BY A 
MAILSAC USER, THE USER AGREES TO ACCEPT FINANCIAL RESPOSIBILITY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THOSE FEES OR JUDGEMENTS.
WHETHER SENT INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY BY THE MAILSAC ACCOUNT OWNER, THE USER ACCEPTS FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE MESSAGES SENT. The user is responsible for mail sent from their account even during a period that the account
was compromised. It is the responsibility of the account holder (user) to secure their account and
contact support via when it appears to have been compromised.

5. Throttling
-------------
Inbound and outbound email traffic is throttled due to various dynamic factors, including but not limited
to: IP addresses, email addresses, domains, frequency of inbound or outbound mail. Mailsac may ban traffic
automatically, on a permanent or temporary basis. Entire domains and companies may be banned. For an up-to-date list of banned traffic,
contact Mailsac support.

We reserve the right to throttle API and SMTP (inbound or outbound) traffic, even for paid customers on unlimited plans. Throttling is necessary to ensure 
quality of service for all other customers.

6. Uptime and Support
---------------------
This service follows a best-effort policy to maintain uptime. No service level agreement (SLA) exists, for
any customer, paying or non-paying, personal or commercial. No SLA is offered on any Mailsac website, including
but not limited to: mailsac.com, Mailsac API, SMTP services, forums, documentation, or blog.

Customers wanting service uptime guarantees must contact a Mailsac account executive to purchase a SLA superceding this agreement.

Support response times are not guaranteed, but support will make a best effort to respond promptly. Support is not offered in any
language other than US English.


7. Accuracy and Compatibility
-----------------------------

7a. Mailsac provides an API service, with free and paid tiers. This service is not responsible for
adverse effects in any situation, and offers no compatibility guarantee. We reserve the right to
change the API without notice. No guarantees are made on the following:

- API uptime or downtime
- API changes or API versioning
- API incompatibility
- API support for a particular programming language
- API help in any language other than English

7b. We make our best effort to produce bug free software and accurate documentation. However the user
acknowledges that the service may perform sub-optimally and in a way that is unexpected, and in such cases
Mailsac is not responsible. We make no guarantees that the service will function as described or intended,
but we hope it does so. There is no guarantee that documentation about the service, including the API or
email routing or email privacy, will be accurate.


8. Data and Retention
---------------------

8a. Deleted data (including messages/email) are removed from the servers and the
databases using standard deletion practices. However we cannot guarantee that
backups may not exist or that business partners (such as hosting companies)
will delete this data. Services which crawl publicly available content (most
emails on this website are public) may retain that information indefinitely and
this website is not responsible. This website makes no guarantees about
retention practices but intends to have deleted content be deleted. Standard
application logs and failed attempts to pass data between internal services may
be retained for troubleshooting. Mailsac is a best-effort, disposable-first email
service and API. Mailsac is not a service that is intended to be used for storage
of important information.

Saved or "starred" messages are intended to be retained up to the indicated
limits on an account, but this is not guaranteed, and starred messages may be
removed when older than other stored messages.

The user agrees that Mailsac is never responsible for lost data. It is the user’s
responsibility to backup or retain any data they may wish to keep.

If data retention or secure deletion is a concern it is recommend that the user 
should not use this service, and find another service upon which to rely.

8b. Usage metrics are tracked. Usage includes but is not limited to:

- IP addresses of site users and API users and SMTP connections
- IP addresses or user accounts of derivable data from service activities

Analytics on received SMTP messages are recorded. We may track which users
or IP addresses view which email addresses and messages for internal purposes, and to create features
for users or organizations to track their usage.

We do not share this analytics data of individual usage with third parties, except when it
is necessary to comply with verified requests of fraud, hacking, or other legally dubious behavior.
We use the data internally to study spam, study traffic, respond to scaling needs, and to provide
more useful services, or to aggregate anonymously into products. We may choose to sell anonymized
or aggregated usage data.


9. Refunds
----------
Refunds are not provided. All purchases are final. Refunds may be provided at the discretion
of Mailsac and its overseers. As a general rule, refunds are never given for any reason. In the
event the service is down or ceases to operate, any unused services and remaining service purchases
are not refunded. We make exceptions on a case-by-case basis with no guarantee as to the methods
for determination. ALL SALES ARE FINAL WHETHER SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED OR NOT.

We may make exceptions to this refund policy on a case-by-case basis.

10. Updates
-----------
These Terms may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this website. Users of
the site WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF CHANGES. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND USERS REGULARLY CHECK THIS WEBSITE
FOR CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE, ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY, AND PRIVACY POLICY.

If the lack of notification of terms changes presents a concern, contact support for a different
arrangement.

IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE

12. Privileges
--------------
This service retains the right to revoke or deny access to anyone at anytime, with or without stated
reason. Likewise any user may cease using the service and request that data be removed, in
accordance with the data and retention policies outlined herein and in the jurisdictions indicated herin. 
As indicated above, refunds are not given.

13. Other Agreements
--------------------
If a clause of this agreement is found to be invalid or violated, the rest of this agreement still stands.

This agreement represents the entire agreement between the user and Forking Software LLC, which includes the Privacy Policy.
The two parties may supersede parts of this agreement through writing signed by legal representatives of
both parties. Clauses of this agreement not addressed in any superseding agreement will still stand.

Non-commercial Use
------------------
Personal (where personal is non-business and non-commercial) use of this website is free.

When using this service within the confines of any business operations, even once, necessitates the
purchase of a yearly license. Incorported or non-incorporated business use is prohibited without a 
paid recurring active commercial subscription.

Email
-----
This site provides public email service. Email inboxes that are not purchased (aka private) are
public and have no privacy whatsoever.

Private addresses will not be accessible publically and access to messages will be provided only to
those with a validated username and password. If you believe your username or password has been
compromised, you must contact the support email address immediately. This website does not accept
responsibility for damages done by compromised accounts. Users acknowledge that overseers and
associates (internal or external parties) may have access to inbox contents for the purpose of
ongoing business operations, but that access and insight will be limited based on direct need
(billing help, troubleshooting, and development comprise the standard reasons for such access, but
others may apply).

Messages receipt is not guaranteed. While this service does not intent for messages to be altered,
there may be arbitrary changes whether during transit or storage which are made without knowledge of
the user. We cannot guarantee accuracy of any email content. Furthermore this service does not know
the quality, truthfullness, correctness, or origination of messages received. Users acknowledge this
and will not hold the website responsible for the content of messages.

Outgoing mail may be purchased at cost and may be delivered by a third party. The user and sender of
this mail is responsible for the content they send. Delivery cannot be guaranteed but may not be
refunded due to incurred costs of attempted delivery. Contact the email support address if delivery
appears to be failing.

The user acknowledges that SMTP is 1) insecure by design, 2) a fail-prone protocol, and 3) a
“legacy” technology which lack modern security best practices.

Outgoing mail may be marked as spam by receivers or intermediary deliverers. This website is not
resonsible for email marked as spam and cannot refund such mail which is marked as spam or
undelivered or unviewed. In the event that legal expenses are incurred for the sending of
messages/email, those will be the responsibility in full of the owner of the account from which the
messages originated, whether or not they were sent intentionally or during a period that the account
was compromised. It is the responsibility of the account holder (user) to secure their account and
contact support via when it appears to have been compromised.

Throttling
----------
Inbound and outbound email traffic is throttled due to various factors, including but not limited
to: IP addresses, email addresses, domains, frequency of inbound or outbound mail. Banning traffic
happens in rare occasions, permanently or temporarily.

We reserve the right to throttle API access, even for paid customers. Such situations are rare, but
may be necessary to ensure quality of service for all other customers.

Downtime
--------
This service follows a best-effort policy to maintain uptime. No service level agreement exists, for
any customer, paying or non-paying, personal or commercial.

Customers wanting service uptime guarantees should contact sales.

Compatability
-------------
Mailsac provides an API service, with free and paid tiers. This service is not responsible for
adverse effects in any situation, including but not limited to: API downtime, API changes, API
incompatibility, lack of API support for a particular language.

Data and Retention
------------------
Deleted data (including messages/email) are removed from the servers and the
databases using standard deletion practices. However we cannot guarantee that
backups may not exist or that business partners (such as hosting companies)
will delete this data. Services which crawl publically available content (most
emails on this website are public) may retain that information indefinitely and
this website is not responsible. This website makes no guarantees about
retention practices but intends to have deleted content be deleted. Standard
application logs and failed attempts to pass data between internal services may
be retained for troubleshooting.

Saved or ‘starred’ messages are intended to be retained up to the indicated
limits on an account.

We are not responsible for lost data. It is the user’s responsibility to backup
or retain any data they may wish to keep.

If data retention is a concern – whether keeping or removing data – it is
recommend that the user do not use this service, and find another service upon
which to rely.

Usage metrics are tracked, including IP addresses of site users, API users, and
SMTP connections, and derivable data from service activities. Analytics on
received SMTP messages are recorded. All of this data may be shared with third
parties including being packaged and resold, or made available via API to
paying or non-paying customers. This data can be used internally to study spam,
or learn about users to provide more compelling services.<Paste>

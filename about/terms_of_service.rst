.. contents:: :local:

Revised March 2023

1. Preamble
-----------

By using Mailsac by Forking Software LLC (also "mailsac.com" "mailsac", "we",
"us", "this/the service", "this/the website", "this/the site"), you (also
"user", "the user", "end user", "customer", "account") accept these terms and
the Privacy Policies (separate agreement) and agree to ABIDE BY THEM AT ALL
TIMES WITH NO EXCEPTION, and with no right to a refund in the event of terms
violation.

You accept that any of these policies and procedures will be available on the
website but that THESE TERMS MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE - you have
been warned. We recommend subscribing to the public repository where this
document's source is hosted.

Terms and policies apply to paid and unpaid features of Mailsac.

"Enterprise" ("enterprise") plans are paid subscriptions to Mailsac services
which include the name "Enterprise" or "enterprise" within them, affording
additional assurances and features throughout the agreement. End users
accessing the service via an account with a current paid Enterprise plan
subscription are "enterprise customers."

The parties will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations,
including without limitation to those arising out of data privacy or any other
rights or obligations set forth in this Agreement.

Each party represents and warrants that:

a. it has full authority to enter and execute and perform its obligations
   under this Agreement;
b. this Agreement will constitute a legal, enforceable and binding
   obligation between the parties;
c. its execution and performance of this Agreement will not violate any
   law or breach any other agreement with or obligation to any third party.

2. Warnings and Acceptable Use
------------------------------

a. Illegal is defined as against the law in the United States, the
   State of California, Sacramento, and the applicable jurisdictions
   of the end user (you).
b. This website can never be used to break the law.
c. You will not send unsolicited spam to this service and you
   will comply with CAN-SPAM as well as applicable international, national, and
   local spam laws in your jurisdiction and the State of California, United
   States.
d. This website and its overseers may cooperate with legal enforcement
   authorities to uphold law enforcement, without necessarily notifying the
   user of such corporation.
e. This website can never be used for malicious activity, terrorist activity,
   planning illegal activities, discussing illegal activities, gambling,
   pornography, or condoning illegal activities.
f. This website can never be used to spread spam, untruth, gambling,
   pornography of any kind whether legal or illegal.
g. Apparent terrorism or threatening behavior, harmful messages or usage to
   conduct intolerant or hateful or discriminatory actions, whether carried
   out, intended, or simulated, proven or unproven, will be blocked and removed
   without notice, and potentially handed over to the proper authorities.
h. This website RESERVES THE RIGHT TO BLOCK OR DELETE MAIL WITHOUT ANY NOTICE
   OR REASON, INCLUDING DATA RETAINED BY PAID USERS. The user agrees to take
   action outside Mailsac services to engage in a backup strategy, when
   persistence is desired or required. ALL MAILSAC DATA, INCLUDING EMAIL
   CONTENTS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES, MUST BE CONSIDERED EPHEMERAL BY THE USER.
i. You agree to be a good citizen of this service and will not engage in any
   activity which degrades the quality, experience or integrity of it, and
   accept that if we determine you are degrading the service for others, your
   usage may be limited in a way which may be undesirable to you.
j. This service reserves the right to delete or block any email for any reason
   without notice and without stating any reason.
k. Unless otherwise indicated, by using the service you acknowledge that all
   of your incoming emails are public, not private, and unsecured, and not
   under copyright or ownership.
l. This service makes no guarantees about how long email will be retained,
   neither minimum nor maximum, or that email will be accepted or received.
m. This service is offered for use with NO WARRANTIES and MAKES NO PROMISES
   THAT IT WILL FUNCTION AS INTENDED OR UNINTENDED. There is no "service level
   agreement" nor any guarantee of service uptime. We provide uptime system
   metrics, such as https://status.mailsac.com, on a purely information basis.
   Nor is status or uptime information required to be available.
n. Use of mailsac to receive emails to facilitate the creation of multiple
   accounts or identities with a third party where the customer does not have
   the expressed written consent of the third party is prohibited.

3. Commercial and Non-Commercial Use
------------------------------------

a. Personal (where personal is non-business and non-commercial) use of this
   website is free, though it may require the user to register for an account
   and provide information such as a legal name, username, email address, phone
   number, physical address, and password. We will store the password using a
   one-way hash which cannot be retrieved by Mailsac.
b. Using this service for any business operations, even once, necessitates the
   purchase of a subscription-based license. Incorporated or non-incorporated
   business use is prohibited without a paid recurring active commercial
   subscription.
c. An exception the previous clause (3c) is made when a business is evaluating
   the service on a temporary trial basis. Service usage for evaluation
   purposes will require the business to abide by these terms, the acceptable
   use guidelines, and the Privacy Policy (separate agreement).
d. Mailsac services and customer assets (aka "entitlements") such as email
   addresses or custom domains, API keys, or other service features, will be
   locked or released publicly if an account's payment status becomes past due
   (aka "delinquent" or "unpaid invoice"). Past due accounts will receive
   courtesy payment reminder emails. MAILSAC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MISSED
   EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS RESULTING IN CANCELED SERVICE.

4. Email
--------
a. Public and Private Email

   This site provides public disposable email services and mixed public-private
   email testing services. Email inboxes that are not purchased (aka private)
   are public and have no expectation of privacy.

   Private addresses will not be accessible publicly and access to messages
   will be provided only to those with:

      i. a validated username and password, which grants a temporary access
         "session" which may be stored in a cookie
      ii. a validated API key (smtp key, api access key, or other key)

b. If you believe your username, password, or API key has been compromised, you
   agree to:

      i. change your compromised password, or delete the compromised API key
      ii. and contact the Mailsac support email address immediately.

c. Mailsac does not accept responsibility for damages done by compromised
   accounts. Users acknowledge that overseers and associates (internal or
   external parties) may have access to inbox contents for the purpose of
   ongoing business operations, but that access and insight will be limited
   based on direct need, such as but not limited to:

   - billing and subscription help
   - troubleshooting SMTP or API issues reported by you, or issues alerted by
     Mailsac telemetry systems
   - system integration support from Mailsac to you
   - comprise the standard reasons for such access

d. We may aggregate information included in emails, inbound and outbound
   metadata, email attachments, or email body information, for sale or sharing
   with third parties or customers. This aggregated information is useful for
   understanding system trends, spam and viruses sent by malicious systems.

   The Privacy Policy supercedes this agreement, and outlines additional detail
   around sharing of public and private email. When in doubt, THE USER ASSUMES
   CONTENTS OF THEIR DATA ON MAILSAC.COM MAY BE SHARED WITH OTHER PARTIES.
   Mailsac is not a service for conducting sensitive or private matters.

e. Receipt, Delivery, and Message Accuracy Guarantees

   EMAIL MESSAGE RECEIPT AND DELIVERY IS NOT GUARANTEED. Mailsac.com has many
   processes and systems in place built up over years, which result in high
   availability and reliability. Nonetheless the service does NOT provide a
   Service Level Agreement or any certainty of receiving mail.

   While this service does not intend for messages to be altered, there may be
   arbitrary changes whether during transit or storage which are made without
   knowledge of the user. The user's account username and IP address may be
   attached to inbound or outbound email messages.

   We cannot guarantee accuracy of any email content. Furthermore this service
   does not know the quality, truthfulness, correctness, or origination of
   messages received. Email messages may contain viruses. Users acknowledge
   this and will not hold Mailsac responsible for the content of messages.
   Users acknowledge that outside parties often send malicious code, phishing
   (intentionally misleading content), and spam in email messages, and Mailsac
   is unable to accurately determine whether messages are malicious or not.
   Spam ratings and spam scores are for informational purposes only - the user
   acknowledges these may indicate non-spam is spam, and spam is non-spam.

f. Email Security

   The user acknowledges:

   - SMTP and its variants are insecure by design
   - SMTP is a fail-prone protocol
   - SMTP is a "legacy" technology which lacks modern security best practices
   - the SMTP protocol is not guaranteed to be transmitted under encryption
   - when encrypted in transit, email may use broken or insufficient encryption
     algorithms
   - stored emails may not be encrypted at rest
   - third parties (including but not limited to routers, ISPs, intermediary
     providers, email providers including Mailsac) may decrypt and store email,
     even though it was not the message's final destination
   - Mailsac strives for encrypted traffic (HTTPS with TLS, SMTP with TLS),
     however internal traffic or even public API / UI traffic may be
     transmitted unencrypted

5. Throttling
-------------

Inbound and outbound email traffic is throttled due to various dynamic factors,
including but not limited to: IP addresses, email addresses, domains, frequency
of inbound or outbound mail. Mailsac may ban traffic automatically, on a
permanent or temporary basis. Entire domains and companies may be banned. For
an up-to-date list of banned traffic, contact Mailsac support.

We reserve the right to throttle API and SMTP (inbound or outbound) traffic,
even for paid customers on unlimited plans. Throttling is necessary to ensure
quality of service for all other customers.

6. Uptime and Support
---------------------

This service follows a best-effort policy to maintain uptime. No service level
agreement (SLA) exists, for any customer, paying or non-paying, personal or
commercial. No SLA is offered on any Mailsac website, including but not limited
to: mailsac.com, Mailsac API, SMTP services, forums, documentation, or blog.

Customers wanting service uptime guarantees must contact a Mailsac account
executive to purchase a Service Level Agreement (SLA) superceding this
agreement.

Support response times are not guaranteed, but support will make a best effort
to respond promptly. Support is not offered in any language other than US
English.


7. Accuracy and Compatibility
-----------------------------

a. Mailsac provides an API service, with free and paid tiers. This service is
   not responsible for adverse effects in any situation, and offers no
   compatibility guarantee. We reserve the right to change the API without
   notice. No guarantees are made on the following:

   - API uptime or downtime
   - API changes or API versioning
   - API incompatibility
   - API support for a particular programming language
   - API help in any language other than English

b. We make our best effort to produce bug free software and accurate
   documentation. However, the user acknowledges that the service may perform
   sub-optimally and in a way that is unexpected, and in such cases Mailsac is
   not responsible. We make no guarantees that the service will function as
   described or intended, but we hope it does so. There is no guarantee that
   documentation about the service, including the API or email routing or email
   privacy, will be accurate.


8. Data and Retention
---------------------

a. Deleted data (including messages/email) are removed from the servers and the
   databases using standard deletion practices. However, we cannot guarantee
   that backups may not exist or that business partners (such as hosting
   companies) will delete this data. Services which crawl publicly available
   content (most emails on this website are public) may retain that information
   indefinitely and this website is not responsible. This website makes no
   guarantees about retention practices but intends to have deleted content be
   deleted. Standard application logs and failed attempts to pass data between
   internal services may be retained for troubleshooting. Mailsac is a
   best-effort, disposable-first email testing service and API. Mailsac is not a
   service that is intended to be used for storage of important information.
   Saved or "starred" messages are intended to be retained up to the indicated
   limits on an account, but this is not guaranteed, and starred messages may
   be removed when older than other stored messages.

   The user agrees that Mailsac is never responsible for lost data. It is the
   user’s responsibility to backup or retain any data they may wish to keep.

   If data retention or secure deletion is a concern it is recommend that the
   user should not use this service, and should find another service upon which
   to rely.

b. Usage metrics are tracked. Usage includes but is not limited to:

   - IP addresses of site users and API users and SMTP connections
   - IP addresses or user accounts of derivable data from service activities

   Analytics on received SMTP messages are recorded. We may track which users
   or IP addresses view which email addresses and messages for internal
   purposes, and to create features for users or organizations to track their
   usage.

   We do not share this analytics data of individual usage with third parties,
   except when it is necessary to comply with verified requests of fraud,
   hacking, or other legally dubious behavior. We use the data internally to
   study spam, study traffic, respond to scaling needs, and to provide more
   useful services, or to aggregate anonymously into products. We may choose to
   sell anonymized or aggregated usage data.


9. Refunds
----------

Refunds are not provided. All purchases are final. Refunds may be provided at
the discretion of Mailsac and its overseers. As a general rule, refunds are
never given for any reason. In the event the service is down or ceases to
operate, any unused services and remaining service purchases are not refunded.
We make exceptions on a case-by-case basis with no guarantee as to the methods
for determination. ALL SALES ARE FINAL WHETHER SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED OR
NOT.

We may make exceptions to this refund policy on a case-by-case basis.

10. Updates to Terms

time and all updates will be posted on this website. Users of the site WILL NOT
BE NOTIFIED OF CHANGES. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND USERS REGULARLY CHECK THIS WEBSITE

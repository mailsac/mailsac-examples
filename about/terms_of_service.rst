1. Preamble
------------

By using Mailsac (also "mailsac", "we", "us", "this/the service", "this/the website", "this/the site"),
you (also "user", "the user", "end user", "customer") accept these terms and the Privacy Policies (separate agreement) and agree to ABIDE BY THEM AT ALL TIMES WITH NO EXCEPTION, and with no right to a refund in the event of terms violation.

You accept that any of these policies and procedures will be available on the website but
that THESE TERMS MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE - you have been warned.

Terms and policies apply to paid and unpaid features of Mailsac.

2. Warnings and Acceptable Use

* This service is offered for use with NO WARRANTIES and MAKES NO PROMISES THAT IT WILL FUNCTION AS INTENDED OR UNINTENDED. There is no "service level agreement" nor any guarantee of service uptime. We provide uptime system metrics, such as https://status.mailsac.com, on a purely information basis. Nor is status or uptime information required to be available.

3. Commercial and Non-Commercial Use
---------------------
3a. Personal (where personal is non-business and non-commercial) use of this website is free, though it may require
the user to register for an account and provide information such as a legal name, username, email address, phone number,
physical address, and password. We will store the password using a one-way hash which cannot be retrieved by Mailsac.

3b. Using this service for any business operations, even once, necessitates the purchase of a subscription-based license. Incorporated or non-incorporated business use is prohibited without a paid recurring active commercial subscription.

3c. An exception the previous clause (3c) is made for subscriptions and services containing the text "trial". However,
"trial" usage will require the business to abide by these terms, the acceptable use guidelines, and the Privacy Policy (separate agreement).

4. Email
--------
4a. Public and Private Email

This site provides public email services and mixed public-private email testing. Email inboxes that are not purchased (aka private) are public and have no privacy whatsoever.

Private addresses will not be accessible publicly and access to messages will be provided only to
those with:
- a validated username and password, which grants a temporary access "session" which may be stored in a cookie
- a validated API key (smtp key, api access key, or other key)

If you believe your username or password has been compromised, you must contact the support email address immediately. 
This website does not accept responsibility for damages done by compromised accounts. Users acknowledge that overseers and
associates (internal or external parties) may have access to inbox contents for the purpose of
ongoing business operations, but that access and insight will be limited based on direct need
(billing help, troubleshooting, and development comprise the standard reasons for such access, but
others may apply). We may aggregate information included in emails, inbound and oubound metadata, email attachements,
or email body information, for sale or sharing with third parties or customers.

The Privacy Policy outlines additional detail around sharing of public and private email. When in doubt, THE USER ASSUMES
CONTENTS OF THEIR DATA ON MAILSAC.COM MAY BE SHARED WITH OTHER PARTIES. Mailsac is not a service for conducting sensitive 
or private matters.

4b. Receipt and Message Accuracy Guarantees

Messages receipt is not guaranteed. While this service does not intent for messages to be altered,
there may be arbitrary changes whether during transit or storage which are made without knowledge of
the user. The user's account username and IP address may be attached to inbound or outbound email messages.

We cannot guarantee accuracy of any email content. Furthermore this service does not know
the quality, truthfulness, correctness, or origination of messages received. Users acknowledge this
and will not hold the website responsible for the content of messages. Users acknowledge that outside
parties often send viruses and intentionally misleading content (spam) in email messages, and Mailsac
is unable to accurately determine whether messages are spam. Spam ratings and spam scores are for
informational purposes only - the user acknowledges these may indicate non-spam is spam, and spam is non-spam.

4c. Email Security

The user acknowledges:

- SMTP and its variants are insecure by design
- SMTP is a fail-prone protocol
- SMTP is a "legacy" technology which lacks modern security best practices
- the SMTP protocol is not guaranteed to be transmitted under encryption
- when encrypted in transit, email may use broken or insufficient encryption algorithms
- stored emails may not be encrypted at rest
- third parties (including but not limited to routers, ISPs, intermediary providers, email providers including Mailsac) may decrypt and store email, even though it was not the message's final destination

4d. Outbound Mail

Outgoing mail may be purchased at cost and may be delivered/relayed by a third party OR Mailsac. The user and sender of
this mail is responsible for the content they send. Delivery cannot be guaranteed. Messages which fail to be
not be delivered will not be refunded. Contact Mailsac support if delivery appears to be failing and we may
be able to assist with troubleshooting, but again we make no guarantees about outbound message delivery.

Outgoing mail may be marked as spam by receivers or intermediary deliverers. Mailsac is not
responsible for email delivered by Mailsac being marked as spam, and WILL NOT refund such mail which is 
marked as spam or undelivered or unviewed.

Sending spam email is a serious offense.

IN THE EVENT THAT LEGAL EXPENSES OR FINANCIAL JUDGEMENTS ARE INCURRED FOR THE SENDING OF EMAIL MESSAGES BY A 
MAILSAC USER, THE USER AGREES TO ACCEPT FINANCIAL RESPOSIBILITY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THOSE FEES OR JUDGEMENTS.
WHETHER SENT INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY BY THE MAILSAC ACCOUNT OWNER, THE USER ACCEPTS FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE MESSAGES SENT. The user is responsible for mail sent from their account even during a period that the account
was compromised. It is the responsibility of the account holder (user) to secure their account and
contact support via when it appears to have been compromised.

5. Throttling
----------
Inbound and outbound email traffic is throttled due to various dynamic factors, including but not limited
to: IP addresses, email addresses, domains, frequency of inbound or outbound mail. Banning traffic will
happens permanently or temporarily. Entire domains and companies may be banned. For an up-to-date list of banned traffic,
contact Mailsac support.

We reserve the right to throttle API access, even for paid customers. Throttling is necessary to ensure 
quality of service for all other customers.

6. Downtime
--------
This service follows a best-effort policy to maintain uptime. No service level agreement exists, for
any customer, paying or non-paying, personal or commercial.

Customers wanting service uptime guarantees should contact sales.


7. Compatability
-------------
Mailsac provides an API service, with free and paid tiers. This service is not responsible for
adverse effects in any situation, and offers no compatibility guarantee. We reserve the right to
change the API without notice. No guranatees are made on the following:

- API downtime
- API changes
- API incompatibility
- API support for a particular programming language
- API help in any language other than English


8. Data and Retention
------------------

8a. Deleted data (including messages/email) are removed from the servers and the
databases using standard deletion practices. However we cannot guarantee that
backups may not exist or that business partners (such as hosting companies)
will delete this data. Services which crawl publicly available content (most
emails on this website are public) may retain that information indefinitely and
this website is not responsible. This website makes no guarantees about
retention practices but intends to have deleted content be deleted. Standard
application logs and failed attempts to pass data between internal services may
be retained for troubleshooting.

Saved or "starred" messages are intended to be retained up to the indicated
limits on an account.

The user agrees that Mailsac is never responsible for lost data. It is the user’s
responsibility to backup or retain any data they may wish to keep.

If data retention or secure deltion is a concern it is recommend that the user 
should not use this service, and find another service upon which to rely.

8b. Usage metrics are tracked. Usage includes but is not limited to:

- IP addresses of site users and API users and SMTP connections
- IP addresses or user accounts of derivable data from service activities

Analytics on received SMTP messages are recorded. We may track which users
or IP addresses view which email addresses and messages. All analytics data may 
be shared with third parties including being packaged and resold, or made available 
via API to paying or non-paying customers. This data can be used internally to study spam,
or learn about users, to provide more useful services, and to sell as a product
for customers to derive value.

9. Refunds
----------
Refunds are not provided. All purchases are final. Refunds may be provided at the discretion
of Mailsac and its overseers. As a general rule, refunds are never given for any reason. In the
event the service is down or ceases to operate, any unused services and remaining service purchases
are not refunded. We make exceptions on a case-by-case basis with no guarantee as to the methods
for determination. ALL SALES ARE FINAL WHETHER SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED OR NOT.

10. Updates
-----------
These Terms may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this website. Users of
the site WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF CHANGES. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND USERS REGULARLY CHECK THIS WEBSITE
FOR CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE, ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY, AND PRIVACY POLICY.

If the lack of notification of terms changes presents a concern, contact support for a different
arrangement.

11. Privileges
-------------
This service retains the right to revoke or deny access to anyone at anytime, with or without stated
reason. Likewise any user may cease using the service and request that data be removed, in
accordance with the data and retention policies outlined herein and in the jurisdictions indicated herin. 
As indicated above, refunds are not given.

12. Other Agreements
--------------------
If a clause of this agreement is found to be invalid or violated, the rest of this agreement still stands.

This agreement represents the entire agreement between the user and Mailsac, which includes the Privacy Policy.
The two parties may supersede parts of this agreement through writing signed by legal representatives of
both parties. Clauses of this agreement not addressed in any superseding agreement will still stand.

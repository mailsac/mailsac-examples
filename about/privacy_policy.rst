Privacy Policy
==============

Revised September 2022

Mailsac is a service of Forking Software LLC.

1. Preamble
-----------

1a. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Mailsac service by Forking Software LLC (mailsac.com, associated sites, and backend or frontend
internet services that support the mailsac.com website).

1b. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Mailsac. It will educate the user of the following:

- 1b-i. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
- 1b-ii. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
- 1b-iii. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
- 1b-iv. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

2. Email
--------
This site provides public (non-private) email, and public or private email testing services. Email inboxes that are not purchased (AKA private) are public and have no privacy expectation. Email inboxes and custom domains which are marked "public" by the user also have
no expectation of privacy. Enhanced addresses which are "released" or "deleted" or
for which the account loses good standing (such as due to a past-due subscription), may become non-private again.

Consider this warning carefully when you opt to receive email on this website and give out addresses
that will have email delivered to this website. Email is PUBLICLY VIEWABLE CONTENT unless otherwise explicitly indicated.
On private email, we reserve the right to inspect or share information contained in those emails, but it REASONABLY
EXPECTED that mail termed "private" will not be made viewable to the public at large or to any third party. However it
MAY BE MADE PUBLIC due to lack of payment or lapsed accounts, and it MAY BE MADE AVAILBLE to third parties in the case
of:
1. fraud complaints, in which case Mailsac may share data upstream to the verified entity complaining of fraud
2. cybersecurity incident requests related to fraud from entities deemed reliably verified by the Mailsac team
3. requests from government agencies based in the United States of America

In the case of information sharing, Mailsac will attempt to notify the account holder via email, if mail can be
determined to be linked to an account. Mailsac will not notify the account holder if a government agency requests otherwise.

3. Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

3a. We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site, email received to PUBLIC email addresses on
this site, email TURNED PUBLIC due to released private email addresses or domains or unpaid accounts, and ALL
derived/aggregated analytics about email or usage on the website.
We will not sell the private email contents to third parties (such as email in private reserved addresses, custom domain
email, or records linking an account or IP address to an email address or custom domain).

information to help the customer troubleshoot, which may include IP addresses, inbound email

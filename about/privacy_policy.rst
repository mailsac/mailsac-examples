Privacy Policy
==============

Revised December 2019

1. Preamble
-----------

1a. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Mailsac service by Forking Software LLC (mailsac.com, associated sites, and backend or frontend
internet services that support the mailsac.com website).

1b. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Mailsac. It will educate the user of the following:

- 1b-i. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
- 1b-ii. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
- 1b-iii. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
- 1b-iv. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

2. Email
--------
This site provides public (non-private) email, and public or private email testing services. Email inboxes that are not purchased (AKA private) are public and have no privacy expectation. Private addresses which are "released" or
for which the account loses good standing (such as due to a past-due subscription), may become non-private again.

Consider this warning carefully when you opt to receive email on this website and give out addresses
that will have email delivered to this website. Email is PUBLICLY VIEWABLE CONTENT unless otherwise explicitly indicated.
On private email, we reserve the right to inspect or share information contained in those emails, but it REASONABLY 
EXPECTED that mail termed "private" will not be made viewable to the public at large or to any third party. However it
MAY BE MADE PUBLIC due to lack of payment or lapsed accounts, and it MAY BE MADE AVAILBLE to third parties in the case
of fraud complaints or other security requests from entities deemed reliably verified by the Mailsac team.

3. Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
-------------------------------------------

3a. We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site, email received to public email addresses on

We may choose to sell or rent this information to third parties, manually or via paid or free API, or by exporting archives of information to third parties. We will not sell the private email contents to third parties.

3b. We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We may share
your information with third parties outside of our organization, for the purpose of providing better
and more relevant services to you.

products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

We use cookies on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s device to help 
us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we 
use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving
time while on our site.

Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we
have no access to or control over these cookies.

8. Sharing
----------
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. We do our best to not
link to any personal information that can identify any individual person, but this cannot be guaranteed. We do
our best to limit sharing email contents or usage with our financial providers, but that information is necessary
often (such as but not limited to fraud investigation and collateral background info).

We use Stripe for payment processing to bill users for services and may provide information about 
you to them. They may retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information.

We are not responsible for third party usage of your information. Refer to their privacy policies and terms.

9. Links and Content

9a. This website contains links to other sites. This website displays email information received by 
unknown parties over the internet.

Be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites or of email received.

any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

Users agree to exercise extreme caution when visiting links and downloading attachments in emails received by this website.

9c. Outgoing mail sent through this service may be interceptable or publicly viewable and shared with

and at rest, but there are exceptions and data may be transmitted or stored without encryption.

(for example, billing, troubleshooting team or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information,
or if requested by law enforcement, or in the event of a customer security issue we may give limited
information to help the customer troubleshoot, which may include IP addresses, inbound email 
addresses, domains, and user account or username information (but not password hashes) for other 
customers or users of the service who appear to have performed acts intended to cause harm to 
another customer. Workers may or may not be employees of Mailsac.

11d. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. Mailsac
relies on third party virtual server providers. Below is a non-exhaustive list of server providers which may be used by 
Mailsac. For a current list, contact support@team.mailsac.com.

11f. We may track analytics on 1) inbound email, 2) outbound email, and 3) API or website usage - as a feature for 
customers or third parties to consume.

is expected to check back here for updates, and we reserve the right to NOT NOTIFY the user via email

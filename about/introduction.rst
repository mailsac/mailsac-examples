Introduction
============
Until now, interacting with email was limitted using desktop or web based 
clients. Mailsac allows you to interact with your email via REST API,
webhooks and websockets. How easy is it? Easy. 

--------------------------------------------

You can use curl to view emails sent to admin@mailsac.com

.. literalinclude:: intro_curl.bash
    :language: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 1
    :lines: 1-35,49-51

.. tip:: This may look for more information than you need. But it provides
         a great example of all the hard work mailsac has done to make parsing
         of email easier.

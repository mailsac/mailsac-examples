Mailsac Docs
============

Welcome to the official documentation for Mailsac, the disposable email
service built for developers.

Mailsac accepts nearly all email, like a fake SMTP server. You can fetch and
manage email using simple REST APIs, WebSockets, and Webhooks; route mail to
Slack, or check it with POP3.

Newcomers may want to look at
the :ref:`introduction page <about_intro>` to get an overview of what Mailsac
has to offer.

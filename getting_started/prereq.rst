=======================

There are only two programs you need to get started:
* `curl <https://curl.haxx.se/>`_
* `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_

If you are using Linux or OS X curl is likely
already installed. The `jq download <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/>`_ page provides
installation instructions for most operating systems.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: For operating system using apt

   $sudo apt-get install jq curl -y

.. tip:: Windows users can use `chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/>`_ to install jq and curl
